# Data Visualization For Quora Framework:v:
* In this kernel  I had basically implemented all the data visualsation methods which can be used to visualsation easily in any kind of the repository.
* It is basically made on the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib with  a little bit use of the Word cloud.
* But still we will be going to need to more of the visualsation from it.
* I wanted to thanks speciall to the 


## Getting Started
* First Download the Dataset from the link given in the Data Sources field as the dataset was quite large.
* Clone the repo 
* Go to the File and run the .py file through cmd with python3 as the default python version/virtual environment could also be used in it.

## How Things Are Working
* First we had cleaned the dataset and deleted some of the columns from the dataset so that we can filter the important vs unimportant.
* Changed the name of the Columns according to the Dataset we had got.
* class SpamClassifier(object): It is basically takes the input as an object and train the model to find the keywords is spam or not.
* Tkinter is basically used for the  showing the answer in the input box form as the Mail is Good Email or Spam Email.
### Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python3
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and other Libraries
* Visualization:Plotly and Numpy

### Data Sources:
Datasets used for the analysis can be found on the given [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification):smiley:.
### Prerequisites
Pre install all the dependencies before cloning the repo
```
pip install python3 seaborn matplotlib numpy plotly
```
You should already need to have all the dependencies installed already.:boom:

## Built With 

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Best Editor for the Code Writing and Debugging
* [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - All the dependecy are used on Python3
* [Kaggle For QUora Data Science Framework](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) -Get the Dataset from here.

## Acknowledgments

* Get the basic idea about how to do the simple data visualsation without any hassle.
* It was quite easy to visualised the dataset if you have already some knowledge about the dataset.
